Ava was initially misdiagnosed before she was diagnosed with a rare form of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage.

Her original diagnosis was T-Cell Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, but was later changed to Biphenotypic Leukemia.  
Ava’s treatment wasn’t easy, but she fought her cancer with grace, determination, and a sense of humor. She endured 28 months of grueling chemotherapy and 10 days of cranial radiation therapy. Through it all, she lit up the hospital room with her smile and laugh. 
Ava is now a sweet 13 year old who loves middle school. She loves to draw and is working on mastering new artistic techniques. Despite her radiation and harmful treatments at such a young age, Ava thrives in school. She is an excellent student and has surmounted all her academic challenges.  When Ava isn’t busy working hard on her school work, she loves to create art and listen to music. She loves to be with her best friend, her siblings, and her parents.

He was unresponsive, and he could not walk or talk. His mother took him to MRMC where he got a CT scan. The doctors said he had fluid on his brain, so he was  taken to UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital. After an emergency MRI, the doctors discovered a large mass tumor connected to his central nervous system and cluster tumors in his optic pathways. Ayden immediately went into emergency brain surgery to place shunts in the outer cavity of his skull to drain  the fluid out of his head and down into his stomach. Doctors later found a cancerous tumor on his heart. After a year and a half of chemotherapy treatment,  Ayden is completely blind from the pressure of the tumor on his brain and optic nerves. He has undergone a total of 17 surgeries, and doctors have deemed him stable.  Ayden’s family is moving to St Augustine where he  will attend the Florida Blind and Deaf School.

He also has  DiGeorge Syndrome, a chromosomal micro-deletion of his 22nd chromosome. When Camden was a year and a half old, his parents decided to move back to Washington where rest of their family lived.  One day on the road trip, he  developed a high fever, so his parents took him to the local emergency room. When the Children’s Hospital of Orange County transport team arrived to take better care of Camden, they realized how seriously ill he was. He went into cardiac arrest, and it took five minutes to revive him. . Upon arriving to the CHOC, Camden was rushed to the Cardiac ICU. The cardiothoracic surgeon told Camden’s parents that his heart was in an advanced stage of heart failure. She recommended placing Camden on ECMO (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation), which is one of the most advanced forms of life support available today. This was the first time we were ever seriously told that we should be prepared for Camden to pass. About an hour after he was placed on ECMO, his heart experienced a potentially fatal arrhythmia. That’s when doctors decided Camden needed a heart and lung transplant.  After being on ECMO for five days, Camden developed an abdominal bleed and needed emergency surgery. The surgery was risky, but he pushed through. Camden’s parents then decided to move back to Florida, where the doctors knew him well and could make a better case to present to the trasplant committee. The next several months at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital  included extensive rehab therapy. After five long months at the hospital including 52 days of intubation, Camden was finally able to go home.  He  spent the rest of 2013 in and out of the hospital, and in January 2014 he became very sick. Camden was falling fast, and he had become dependant on the IV drug milrinone.  In  March2014 his parents brought him home with hospice care in place.  After four months, Camden began to wean off of his milrinone drip, and on Oct. 29, 2014, after 285 days on milrinone, his cardiologist turned off his infusion pump.  Camden has endured two major open heart surgeries, two abdominal surgeries, three general surgeries and five heart catheterizations. He is now three and a half years old.',

After numerous misdiagnoses, a simple blood test revealed that his marrow had stopped producing normal blood cells and has been taken over by leukemia/cancer. He was admitted to the PICU that night began chemotherapy the next morning. Dylan had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. He received 3 ½ years of spinal, intravenous, intramuscular and oral chemotherapy. He continues to receive follow up care due to lasting effects of the chemo on his body. We all have a whole new perspective on what is really important. We have met some of the most incredible, inspiring people along this journey. It has increased our love and compassion for others infinitely. Some of the bravest people I know are children who smile and laugh through the most horrific of circumstances. My son is one of those and I am thankful for the way my eyes have been opened to the beauty and bravery of others stories. I always say how lucky we are because we have this amazing children’s hospital right in our backyard. People look at me like I am crazy, but it is truly such a blessing. We were able to close to home and family throughout the 3 ½ years of treatment. Having another young child at home, this was so important to me. We didn’t have to sacrifice anything. I had no doubt about Dylan’s team and the incredible level of care and resources available to them at Shands. I know he was cared for by the best! Shands is our home away from home.

Two years ago, after vomiting over 30 times and not tolerating any fluids, Elie was brought to the Shands Pediatric ER where her blood sugar was 42 and she ultimately had a seizure. Because of this episode we were referred to Dr. Weinstein, a world-renowned doctor in this field. We learned that patients with this disorder are unable to fully break down glycogen to glucose, and therefore are dependent on a continuous supply of glucose. Without this supply of glucose hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis and seizures can occur.

Since learning more about GSD Elie is able to check her own blood sugar and ketones by pricking her finger when she is not feeling well. She has to have a snack at regular times and take a protein supplement 3 times a day. Many GSD patients have to also take corn starch with their protein but Elie is not required to do so. Because of the GSD it can take longer for her to recover from a typical fever or stomach bug. Even though sometimes she may not feel well she still loves tumbling and gymnastics. We can’t get her to stop jumping off the couches! She also loves to play piano and play outside with friends. Elizabeth is a lover of animals that are furry and not so furry. If you ask her what her favorite subject is in school she will say it is art.

We love Dance Marathon because it gives us the opportunity to meet families that have shared a common health struggle. We hope it gives Elie a sense of not being alone in her disease process and we also hope to share more about GSD with others. ',

cancer in my left kidney so the next day they flew me to Shand’s Hospital. A couple of days later, I had a

biopsy surgery and then began 9 months of treatment. They had to remove my left kidney and I got chemo,

radiation. Then I went back to my home in Belize, Central America. But one year later, the cancer came

back in my lungs. I had 9 more months of treatment - I got chemo, radiation and stem cell transplant. It

wasn’t very fun. But I loved my doctors, nurses and volunteers. And so many people provided stuff to make

it nicer, like child-size equipment for taking my blood pressure, movies and games, because it is really

boring being in the hospital all of the time. I love Dance Marathon – they have been so supportive of

She was transferred to Joe Dimaggio where she was stabilized and at almost five months old she was diagnosed with an extremely rare disease, so rare that it doesn’t have a name yet. Basically her lungs didn’t work and her only cure or chance at life would be a lung transplant. Two years ago in May we were transferred to Shands Hospital to receive that lung transplant. She was placed on the waiting list and we waited nine months for the call. Doctors never thought she would make it. Her transplant was performed on January 27, 2013 and she was discharged for the first time in her life on March 20th.

In May of 2012 when he was an 11 year old 6th grader, he was diagnosed with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia).    When his bloodwork came back not as mono but Leukemia our pediatrician told us to take him that very day to see Dr. Slayton at Shands Children’s Hospital.

Our first few days were a blur of tests and meetings as they worked to define exactly what type and subtype of leukemia he had.  We learned that instead of the more common ALL he had AML.  We also learned that it was in his spinal fluid as well.  The treatment for Jack’s AML was 4 consecutive rounds of chemotherapy.  They told us that he would likely be at Shands for 6 months and that it would be unlikely that he could go home at all during that time.

And so we became a family divided, with one parent at home with his sisters and one at the hospital from May until the end of October.   Jack celebrated his 12th birthday in the awesome game room in 42 Peds with visiting friends, pizza, cookie cake and games.  As the treatment continued visits like that would become less possible as he suffered the side effects and other illnesses that come with so much chemo and such a fragile immune system.  He was able to keep in touch with some of his friends through xbox live and a several sets of headsets!

Through it all Jack was amazing.  He defied the odds and we were able to bring him home for a couple of days in between some of the rounds!  How grateful we were to all be together and know that he was asleep in his own bed!  He always told the doctors, nurses and his parents exactly what was on his mind.  He didn’t complain (much), not nearly as much as he should have!  His distinctive sense of humor and practical jokes were a joy and we are so proud of him for holding on to that during his treatment!  (Ask him about his trip to the PICU and the monitors sometime, or the remote control spider!).

Jack is our HERO.

Our prayers were answered when we brought him home and we thank God every day for his remission!  We also thank God for the amazing doctors, nurses, volunteers, social workers, and everyone else who devotes so much of their lives to making it possible for kids like Jack to not only SURVIVE, but to have some comfort during that time!  The funds raised by CMN make such a huge difference in the level of care available for these kids!  What a difference it makes to know you have available the best and brightest and most dedicated doctors and nurses, the latest drugs and therapies, all of the support staff imaginable to help the kids and their families get through times like these!  And to the Dance Marathon kids, you ROCK!  It is not just about fundraising, it’s also how you make all of our kids feel special and loved, and we thank you for all that you do FTK!

stats and looked to be the picture of newborn health. Kaedyn did many things early. Walking at nine
months and scrambling to run in the last few weeks as he tried to keep up with his brother Kaleb (his
hero) were things he tackled with spunk and determination.

Two and half weeks before Kaedyn was checked in at UF Health, Shelsie took him to see his
pediatrician because his cheeks were a little swollen. After a quick visit, Kaedyn was diagnosed with
the mumps. A week later, his symptoms continued to worsen to include continued swelling in the
cheeks and obvious pain in his stomach so Shelsie and Nic brought him to the E.R. They were then
told that he was just experiencing the effects of mumps and were directed to take him home being
sure to keep him in isolation. On Thursday night in the wee hours, his pain grew excruciating so he
was again rushed to the E.R. where finally, doctors finally diagnosed him with leukemia and he was
rushed to UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital.

Blood tests confirmed that Kaedyn indeed has Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) which is a cancer of the white blood cells, the cells in the body that normally fight infections. Kaedyn finished his treatment on August 14, 2013. In
just 4 months after treatment ended his cancer returned. His best chance at a cure was a Bone Marrow Transplant. He spent 4 months in the hospital with only a weekend break. He needed chemotherapy and radiation to get his
cancer back under control. It was a very rough patch with multiple infections and him not being allowed out of his room. When his cancer was in remission once again he received his Bone Marrow Transplant on March 22, 2013.
A month after his new cells entered his bloodstream he left the hospital and to this day has not been admitted.
He is doing fantastic and is truly a little miracle child.

            'description' => 'At 28 weeks gestation, I was told that my unborn baby had a Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH). This meant she had a hole in her diaphragm and the organs below her diaphragm could go up through the hole and into her chest cavity. They would then take up the lung space and impede them from growing. As well the organs pushed the heart over to the right side of her body. We lived in Dallas, TX at the time and knew we needed to find the best doctor and hospital in the country to deliver our baby. We found UF Health and Dr. Kays pretty quickly and knew that’s where we would go. We came to Gainesville 1 month before she was born in order to see the doctors throughout the month and make sure we were in town when she was ready to come. I was induce on November 7th and on November 8th, 2011 she made her appearance into the world. I gave birth in an operation room at UF Health, because they needed so many doctors and nurses to fit in the room. We were told that she would not cry when she came out because she wouldn’t have much lung capacity. But, she’s a fighter and the first thing we heard when she came out was a cry. They rushed her off to the side of the room and started to work on getting her intubated and set up on a breathing machine and then took her off to the NICU. They got her stable and let her rest for a day and recover from birth. On day 2 she went in for surgery to repair her diaphragm and see how much lung tissue she actually had. They found that she had 80% of her diaphragm, 70% of her left lung and 100% of her right lung. Over time her heart moved back to the correct position in her chest. After surgery she continued to be on a breathing machine for another 8 days as she learned how to breath on her own. In a 24 hour period the doctors took her off the breathing machine, put her on a c-pap, took her off the c-pap and put a nasal cannula on her. At 10 days old we were able to hold her and feed her for the first time. A few days later they moved her into the step down NICU to learn to eat and gain weight. While still in the NICU, they performed an MRI on her to get her ready for discharge, and they found a blood clot in her brain. A few days later they did another MRI and it showed that the clot had changed slightly in size and they felt like over time the blood would find alternate routes around the clot. She was released from the hospital at 3 weeks old with no air or feeding tubes! This is a big feat for babies with CDH. We ended up going for a check up MRI 6 weeks later to see if her blood clot had changed, and at the appointment they told us it had completely dissolved. We truly believe Lucy Jane is our little miracle and we know that God has used her and her story to share His love to a lot of people.',

Every couple of months of his life seemed to add another specialist who helped unravel the cause of the mutli-system difficulties in Nathan’s body. Testing performed from a surgical muscle biopsy when he was a few months shy of a year old showed that Nathan had mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial Disease is a genetic disorder that has caused havoc on the cells of many organ systems in our son’s body. The mitochondria are responsible for creating 90% of the energy needed by the body to sustain life and support growth. When they fail, cell injury and cell death can occur, and the life of the person whom this is happening is severely compromised. It is a degenerative disease that has no cure. This diagnosis does not deter Nathan from living an incredibly fulfilling life, however shortened it may be. Despite what his limitations are now and in the future, he continues to live a whole and incredibly happy life in however time he is given on this earth. He has lost many friends to this disease, but it does not keep him from living on joyfully through the obstacles that are presented.

Up until age 10, he simply took a daily medication to help his heart beat slowly and easily and lived life like any other boy. That changed in the summer of 2012 when Nick underwent a cardiac MRI to evaluate the size of his heart and its structures.

Our family moved to Gainesville from Ohio in December 2011 for Jodi’s job. At that point, Nick started receiving his heart care from Dr. Jay Fricker at the Congenital Heart Center. Dr. Fricker wanted Nick to have an MRI of his heart. Nick had never had a cardiac MRI before because it really was not available at our previous hospital. The MRI results showed that Nick’s heart size put him at risk for developing a sudden and potentially fatal heart rhythm. We saw an electrophysiologist, Dr. Randall Bryant, who comes from Jacksonville to Gainesville regularly to see patients. Dr. Bryant recommended that Nick have an internal defibrillator placed under his skin with tiny wires attached to his heart so that any life threatening heart rhythm could be shocked back to normal a rhythm if necessary.

Because of Nick’s hypertrophic cardiomyopathy he has regular visits with Dr. Fricker and Dr. Bryant. He has had one cardiac MRI and regularly gets heart echo tests and 12-lead EKG tests. He has also had blood work performed to identify a possible genetic cause for his heart condition. In September 2012 Nick had surgery at Shands for placement of an internal defibrillator. He spent one night on unit 44 pediatrics.

Nick remains a very social and positive guy. He tries his best despite his obstacles. Because of his heart condition, he is not allowed to participate in moderately-intense sports like baseball, soccer or basketball. This makes Nick sad because he loves to play sports especially basketball and is pretty good at throwing a ball. Nick is, however, allowed to participate in the sport of bowling. After being off bowling for nearly 8 weeks to allow his defibrillator surgical site to heal, he got back into the “swing of things!” Nick bowls every Saturday with a Gainesville youth league and participates in 1-2 tournaments each year throughout the state of Florida.

Nick particularly enjoys being involved with Dance Marathon at the University of Florida. He has met so many amazing college students who dedicate their time and energy to raising money for Children’s Miracle Network. Nick loves to hang out with the “big kids” and they treat him like a rock star!

Samueal was ambulanced to the nearest children’s hospital for severe bradycardic episodes and respiratory distress.The months to follow were spent in and out of several hospital ICUs with extensive testing and numerous surgeries.  Teams of physicians tried to discern the source of his multi-systemic health concerns: encephalopathy, global developmental delay, tracheomalacia, seizures, Gastro- Intestinal dysmotility and paresis, hypotonia, oromotor dysfunction, apnea, bradycardia, respiratory insufficiency, and failing to thrive on a GJ feeding tube.. While being told to expect that he might never walk, talk or live a normal life, his parents continued to fight for answers.

This condition is considered degenerative and  progressive and he has fought through very difficult metabolic declines following typical stressors, such as a warm ride in the stroller or even a simple ear infection.

While practicing his basketball skills with his father, we noticed that Tyler could not bring his arm in without shaking uncontrollably. We decided to have this examined, and this was the beginning of a long and disheartening journey. Tyler was in and out of UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital in Gainesville, Fla. and many other renowned hospitals. Tyler was examined by many specialists that performed numerous painful tests and treatments that resulted in dead ends and misdiagnosis. This was extremely frustrating to everyone, but none more than Tyler. During one of Tyler’s inpatient stays at UF Health Shands, we were introduced to Dr. Michael Okun. This meeting resulted in his examination of Tyler and rendering a diagnosis of Primary Generalized Early-Onset Dystonia, and  confirmed with a blood test for the Dyt1 Dystonia gene. Though we were all relieved to have a “diagnosis”, we were also very distraught as we learned about this devastating disorder. Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder affecting the central nervous system, characterized by involuntary, and often painful, spasms of the muscles. This disorder currently has no cure and progressively robs one of their ability to control voluntary movements and even the ability to walk. The earlier that a child shows symptoms of Dystonia, the more significant those symptoms become. Our son, Tyler, is now very disabled. Although Tyler grows physically and mentally normally, he is twisted, cannot eat or speak without extreme difficulty, cannot walk, read a book, or play with other kids like he used to. Tyler is remarkably good-natured and continues to have a positive attitude about his dystonia. A few years after Tyler’s diagnosis, our daughter Samantha started showing symptoms and was diagnosed with generalized dystonia. Since Tyler and Samantha have the genetic form, there is a 50/50 chance that our youngest child will carry this gene with a 30% chance that he will become symptomatic of it.',

He spent most of the first year of his life sick – reflux, congestion, extreme eczema, repeated respiratory infections, including pneumonia at 8 months old, which landed him in our local hospital for a week. When William was 11 months old, he was hospitalized again — this time with rotavirus. It was during that hospital stay that his new doctor diagnosed William with Scimitar Syndrome, after he had received a chest CT scan done to rule out a possible respiratory infection. Scimitar Syndrome is a birth defect that adversely affects the right lung and right side of the heart. In June 2006, when William was 2, he underwent his first open-heart surgery. Life ran smoothly until August 2012, when Dr. Fricker noticed the slightest change in William’s heart. William had a cardiac MRI and then underwent his second cardiac catheterization. The MRI and cath showed that William had a blockage in his scimitar vein and had developed pulmonary hypertension. Five days before Christmas in 2012, when William was 8, he underwent his second open-heart surgery with Dr. Bleiweis. Since then, we have cardiology and pulmonary checkups every 6 months. In February 2014, Dr. Fricker noticed that William’s pulmonary pressures were creeping up again. In May 2014, William underwent his third cardiac cath. During the 8-hour procedure, they were able to balloon open William’s scimitar vein and his inferior vena cava, both of which were blocked. The angioplasty procedure saved William from another immediate open-heart surgery. He will need more interventions in the future, but he’s doing very well right now. He plays flag football and has been able to keep up with his friends much better than before his interventional cath. William has had so many “best days of his life”, a few of which were made possible by Children’s Miracle Network.
