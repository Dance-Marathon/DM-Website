He was unresponsive, and he could not walk or talk. His mother took him to MRMC where he got a CT scan. The doctors said he had fluid on his brain, so he was  taken to UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital. After an emergency MRI, the doctors discovered a large mass tumor connected to his central nervous system and cluster tumors in his optic pathways. Ayden immediately went into emergency brain surgery to place shunts in the outer cavity of his skull to drain  the fluid out of his head and down into his stomach. Doctors later found a cancerous tumor on his heart. After a year and a half of chemotherapy treatment,  Ayden is completely blind from the pressure of the tumor on his brain and optic nerves. He has undergone a total of 17 surgeries, and doctors have deemed him stable.  Ayden’s family is moving to St Augustine where he  will attend the Florida Blind and Deaf School.

							'description' => "During my pregnancy I received several fetal echos and heart monitoring screens in order to prepare for the safest delivery of Bennett. Ended up have another c-section to ensure no strain on his heart for delivery; once he was born he was whisked off to the NICU 3 for monitoring. The doctors wanted to make sure Bennett’s o2 sats would stay up 70%, if not he would require surgery right away. Bennett’s oxygen saturation levels were maintaining is the low 70’s which made doctors happy. He was transferred to NICU 2 and we were finally able to hold him and I was allowed to nurse him, when he was 4 days old. Since his saturation levels were maintaining he was discharged home with pulse ox monitoring and weekly cardiology appointments. The plan was for Bennett to get bigger and stronger before needing to do surgery. We only stayed home for 1 week before Bennett was admitted back to the hospital. His o2 sats were low at his cardiology check up. Lab work showed that his hct was low and required a blood transfusion. My mother in-law was a match and was able to donate blood to Bennett. After receiving the 2 units his o2 sats came right back up. Unfortunately also ended up showing he had SVT (supra ventricular tachycardia) and was placed on propranolol to help slow his heart rate. After 1 week he was sent back home. Bennett progressed well and grew bigger than expected. Doctors were so happy with his size and said you wouldn’t even know by looking at him that he was a heart baby. On December 5 th , at 3 months old, Bennett had his first open heart surgery. He had a bilateral bidirectional glen with pulmonary banding. Surgery went well and he was discharged home a week and half after surgery. Unfortunately he ended back up in the hospital 1 week later. Fluid accumulated around his heart. They had to drain it. So Bennett checked in for another week stay. Since the last procedure in January, Bennett has stayed out of the hospital and his progressing great. He will be 3 this August, he next cardiology appointment is in June. His doctors mentioned at that appointment, they will most likely schedule him for a cardiac cath, to gather more information and help determine when his next open heart surgery will be. The final repair is called the fontan procedure. After this surgery, Bennett should be in the clear. If for some unseen reason his heart begins to fail after this final repair he would need a transplant, but this isn’t a thought in anyone’s mind at this point because Bennett is fighting his CHD like a true warrior.",

Camden was sent by air ambulan from Fort Walton Beach to UF Health Shands Hospital due to a severe congenital heart defect called Tetralogy of Fallot with Pulmonary Atresia. After several weeks we learned that his heart defect was caused by a genetic syndrome called DiGeorge Syndrome. Camden has endured two major open heart surgeries, 2 major abdominal surgeries, 6 heart catheterizations, and countless other procedures requiring anesthesia. Camden suffered some complications from his second open heart surgery that resulted in him going into right sided heart failure and he had to spend five days on the most advanced and risky form of life support possible called ECMO (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation). While on ECMO Camden suffered a very severe and debilitating brain bleed resulting in the loss of 95% of his motor skills/abilities. One year later Camden came down with RSV and his heart failure got worse. It was at this point we were told that he probably would pass before he turned three. Camden clearly didn’t agree with that prognosis and now at five years old he’s still going strong and showing heart failure who’s the boss!
															Through extensive physical and occupational therapy, we are happy to report that Camden is regaining some of his mobility though he will likely never walk or talk.

After hours of tears, worry, phone calls and visits from church friends We got the call. She made it through surgery and she was alive! After a total of 5 weeks in the hospital we were going home.  The months that followed were rough. Dani-Lynn started to become very congested but her previous cardiologists didn&#39;t seem concerned. I continued to take her to the ER but kept getting sent home with no answers  I kept calling her cardiologists and never got answers, I kept being told i was an overprotective mother and my baby is fine.... My baby was not fine, she was struggling to breath, her o2 was steadily dropping and her color was starting to change. On a cold Dec. Day in 2015 was the day that our lives did a 180. I checked her o2 and it was in the low 60&#39;s, I knew this wasn&#39;t right, her congestion was worse.  After putting a call out to her cardiologist and her surgeon calling me back and canceling her second surgery because of the congestion and her previous cardiologist not communicating with her surgeon I made a life changing choice.  My motherly instinct kicked in and on that december day, we became a shands Gainesville family.I took her into the ER and told them at check-in "I have a heart baby, we are from Jacksonville and She has been heavily congested for 4 months and her oxygen levels are low."  That was the day I was told by many medical staff your daughter is a miracle and we can&#39;t explain why she&#39;s alive!

After numerous misdiagnoses, a simple blood test revealed that his marrow had stopped producing normal blood cells and has been taken over by leukemia/cancer. He was admitted to the PICU that night began chemotherapy the next morning. Dylan had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. He received 3 ½ years of spinal, intravenous, intramuscular and oral chemotherapy. He continues to receive follow up care due to lasting effects of the chemo on his body. We all have a whole new perspective on what is really important. We have met some of the most incredible, inspiring people along this journey. It has increased our love and compassion for others infinitely. Some of the bravest people I know are children who smile and laugh through the most horrific of circumstances. My son is one of those and I am thankful for the way my eyes have been opened to the beauty and bravery of others stories. I always say how lucky we are because we have this amazing children’s hospital right in our backyard. People look at me like I am crazy, but it is truly such a blessing. We were able to close to home and family throughout the 3 ½ years of treatment. Having another young child at home, this was so important to me. We didn’t have to sacrifice anything.

Three years ago, after vomiting over 30 times and not tolerating any fluids, Elie was brought to Shands Pediatric E.R. where her blood sugar was 42 and ultimately had a seizure. Because of this episode we were referred to Dr. Weinstein, a world-renowned doctor in this field, at UF Health Shands. We learned that patients with this disorder are unable to fully break down glycogen to glucose, and therefore are dependent on a continuous supply of glucose. Without this supply of glucose hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis and seizures can occur. Since learning more about GSD Elie is able to check her own blood sugar and ketones by pricking her finger when she is not feeling well. She has to have a snack every 2 hours and take a protein supplement 3 times a day. Many GSD patients have to take corn starch along with their protein "shake" but Elie is not required to do so. Because of the GSD it can take longer for her to recover from a typical fever or stomach virus. Recently she had a great check-up showing that her labs were normal and she is growing! Even though sometimes she may not feel well she can still be a fierce volleyball player. She plays the piano, builds Legos and loves arts and crafts. Elizabeth is also a lover of animals that are furry and not so furry. We love Dance Marathon because it gives us the opportunity to meet families that have shared a common health struggle.

						'description' => 'She had ALL leukemia when she was 2 and finished chemo when she was 5.  She was misdiagnosed by the pediatrician twice because she didn&#39;t have typical symptoms.  At first, it was a virus.  Then, bronchitis!  I called to get her in after she started antibiotics and the nurse called me back and said not to worry.  It takes 72 hours for the antibiotics to work.  Elyse had a hematocrit on 1.8!!!!  A normal reading is 10!  If they had just pricked her finger 10 days earlier!  She was almost completely out of blood!  Needless to say, we got to ride in an ambulance and were admitted to Shands.  Elyse was so weak and so low on blood, the doctors couldn&#39;t perform a bone marrow biopsy until she had days and days of blood and platelets.
																	Anyway, Elyse stayed in the hospital for 2 weeks, released for 2 days, readmitted for 2 weeks, and so on.  We&#39;d have a break here and there and then be back in Shands.  While there, we received a duck with a port.  This stuffed animal helped Elyse see what was going to be put in her body and helped her understand how important it was.  I&#39;m not going to lie. The first six months was very tough.  The medicines were very harsh and Elyse was in the hospital numerous times.
																	When reviewing the medicines and their side effects, I thought steroids wouldn&#39;t be the problem.  That was the one medicine I had heard of.  I was wrong!  Elyse was starving and moody for a whole month.  She doubled her body weight and became diabetic.  Picture a three year old who just wants to eat 24/7 and you have to refuse to feed her for 2 hours in order to check her blood sugar.  This poor child was begging for someone to poke her finger and bring on the shot just so she could eat.  The surgery days were torture.  No food after midnight.  Thankfully, the amount of steroids were reduced during the 26 month ordeal and the diabetes that were induced by the steroids went away.
																	When Elyse finally got to go to the outpatient clinic at Shands, she&#39;d receive all kinds of attention from the nurses, volunteers and especially Jenna Priest, the Child Life Specialist.  She would distract Elyse while her port was being accessed and would really help in keeping me sane.  She was always looking out for us and always wanted Elyse to have fun while stuck in clinic all day.
																	Elyse developed a chronic cough that just wouldn&#39;t go away.  The doctors did X rays, a bronchioscopy, blood work and a CT scan, but could not figure out why she hacked all the time.  After 9 months, my favorite PA who had been on the admitted side of Shands asked what her immunoglobulin level was.  Of course, I had never heard that word before and just said huh.  Another blood test was done and Elyse was introduced to an 8 hour drip of IVIG that finally got rid of the cough.  Elyse needed it once a month to keep the cough away and we were all finally getting sleep again.  Thank you Kenny!  Dr. Slayton from HEMOC combined forced with our new pulmonary doctor to start a study to figure out why certain pediatric cancer patients develop a chronic cough and why IVIG is the only solution.
																	Elyse completed her chemotherapy in October of 2012 and she now goes to Shands for bloodwork and check ups every 3 months.  She is a happy and healthy little girl.  Elyse does great in school and even tells her story sometimes to her class. Through it all Elyse had a smile on her face (minus the steroid days) and did great with taking her medicines.

When we got to the hospital we were told that Isaiah also had a hole in his heart.  The combination of the cardiac and respiratory issues were preventing adequate das exchange to sustain life.  Doctors wanted to put Isaiah on ECMO machine (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation).  This surgical procedure would place a tube in Isaiah&#39;s neck to his heart which would remove blood that would be replaced by oxygenated blood which would then be pumped back in.  Isaiah stay on the machine for 6 days.  By this time he had been in the hospital for 2 weeks and his oxygen level were finally improving, but was not able to be released until about 2 weeks later when it was able to get on his own, the oxygen level stayed consistent, and his blood pressure was controlled.  At 5 weeks old he was finally released.
										Dr. Sullivan thoroughly explained everything to us and didn&#39;t leave us in the dark.  I am forever grateful for her amazing bedside manner.',

At 3 weeks old Izabella had a pulmonary hemorrhage (she bled out from her lungs) which nearly took her life. She was transferred to Joe Dimaggio where she was stabilized and at almost five months old she was diagnosed with an extremely rare disease, so rare that it doesn’t have a name yet. Basically her lungs didn’t work and her only cure or chance at life would be a lung transplant. Two years ago in May we were transferred to Shands Hospital to receive that lung transplant. She was placed on the waiting list and we waited nine months for the call. Doctors never thought she would make it. Her transplant was performed on January 27, 2013 and she was discharged for the first time in her life on March 20th. She has been in and out of the hospital many times since, but continues to amaze doctors with her will to fight for life. CMN has been a great part of our lives in and out of the hospital. Many of the machines used on a daily basis to save Izabella’s life while she was on life support were donated by CMN or by their DM event held each year. DM and CMN have given our kids the opportunity to be "normal"kids outside of the hospital. From the Sweet Dreams event to the FTKarnival Kick off event to Dance Marathon and many other events held by DM and CMN, my kids have enjoyed being surrounded by the young individuals dedicating their lives to helping children like mine.',

In May of 2012 when he was an 11 year old 6th grader, he was diagnosed with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia).    When his bloodwork came back not as mono but Leukemia our pediatrician told us to take him that very day to see Dr. Slayton at Shands Children’s Hospital.
															Our first few days were a blur of tests and meetings as they worked to define exactly what type and subtype of leukemia he had.  We learned that instead of the more common ALL he had AML.  We also learned that it was in his spinal fluid as well.  The treatment for Jack’s AML was 4 consecutive rounds of chemotherapy.  They told us that he would likely be at Shands for 6 months and that it would be unlikely that he could go home at all during that time.
															And so we became a family divided, with one parent at home with his sisters and one at the hospital from May until the end of October.   Jack celebrated his 12th birthday in the awesome game room in 42 Peds with visiting friends, pizza, cookie cake and games.  As the treatment continued visits like that would become less possible as he suffered the side effects and other illnesses that come with so much chemo and such a fragile immune system.  He was able to keep in touch with some of his friends through xbox live and a several sets of headsets!
															Through it all Jack was amazing.  He defied the odds and we were able to bring him home for a couple of days in between some of the rounds!  How grateful we were to all be together and know that he was asleep in his own bed!  He always told the doctors, nurses and his parents exactly what was on his mind.  He didn’t complain (much), not nearly as much as he should have!  His distinctive sense of humor and practical jokes were a joy and we are so proud of him for holding on to that during his treatment!  (Ask him about his trip to the PICU and the monitors sometime, or the remote control spider!). jack is our HERO.
															Our prayers were answered when we brought him home and we thank God every day for his remission!  We also thank God for the amazing doctors, nurses, volunteers, social workers, and everyone else who devotes so much of their lives to making it possible for kids like Jack to not only SURVIVE, but to have some comfort during that time!  The funds raised by CMN make such a huge difference in the level of care available for these kids!  What a difference it makes to know you have available the best and brightest and most dedicated doctors and nurses, the latest drugs and therapies, all of the support staff imaginable to help the kids and their families get through times like these!  And to the Dance Marathon kids, you ROCK!  It is not just about fundraising, it’s also how you make all of our kids feel special and loved, and we thank you for all that you do FTK!',

TGA is where the two main arteries are switched, so the correct blood flows are not going to the correct areas in her body. Kaitlynn was born at 35 weeks. I had an emergency C-Section, and she was brought into this world on April 30, 2015. As soon as she was born, she stopped breathing, and she was taken away from me right away. Thankfully a doctor that was there for a "just in case" scenario, was needed. He performed a balloon septostomy, which just put a hole in her heart to keep all the blood flow the same. As soon as she was as stabilized as she could be they took her into the NICU to do everything else they could to stabilize her to transfer her to Nicklaus Childrens Hospital. At two days old I received a phone call from my husband saying that she has a blood clot in her leg and that we have two options. one was to amputate her leg, and two was to give her a medication that will solve the blood clot but it could send blood rushing to her head and cause neurological damage. This was devastating news for my husband and myself. The blood clot was caused by the balloon septostomy that was performed right after birth. The procedure was first performed on the right leg which broke the blood vessel, so they attempted on her left leg, which was successful. That same say she needed a blood transfusion, which she had. We got the news at three days old that, that coming monday they were going to perform her surgery. She was not stabilizing the way that they were hoping. She had her arterial switch, which is the procedure to correct the transpostion, at 5 days old. It was a complete success. She did very well during surgery and, Surprisingly, did not need ECMO. Although the doctors did say there may be a chance that she could need ECMO. The day after surgery the doctor noticed her heart was leaking, they ended up having to patch a small hole that was leaking. Two days after surgery, Doctor Burke decided it was time to close her chest. Another success. Doctors attempted to extubate her, which unfortunately was not successful. She was still too sedated and paralyzed to breath on her own. About four days after surgery, I was notified that she had a collapsed lung, which is pretty common after a surgery. Three days after the failed extubation, they attempted again, thankfully this one was a success. That same day, she was very close to heart failure. She was given a medicine called Ativan, which calmed her down to relax enough. She had good days and bad days, which I knew were going to happen. 20 full days after she was born, I was FINALLY able to hold her. It seemed that after that, EVERYTHING started to turn around. On March 27, we got the news that she was able to go home soon. On June 1st, we were able to take our little 5 pound peanut home. She went home on only two medications. She is now almost 19 pounds and is taking over our home! She loves just about anything and anyone! I have never seen such a happy, go lucky kid. We are so blessed to call her OURS.',

Up until age 10, he simply took a daily medication to help his heart beat slowly and easily and lived life like any other boy. That changed in the summer of 2012 when Nick, underwent a cardiac MRI to evaluate the size of his heart and its structures.Our family moved to Gainesville from Ohio in December 2011 for Jodi’s job. At that point, Nick started receiving his heart care from Dr. Jay Fricker at the Congenital Heart Center. Dr. Fricker wanted Nick to have an MRI of his heart. Nick had never had a cardiac MRI before because it really was not available at our previous hospital. The MRI results showed that Nick’s heart size put him at risk for developing a sudden and potentially fatal heart rhythm. We saw an electrophysiologist, Dr. Randall Bryant, who
															comes from Jacksonville to Gainesville regularly to see patients. Dr. Bryant recommended that Nick have an internal defibrillator placed under his skin with tiny wires attached to his heart so that any life threatening heart rhythm could be shocked back to normal a rhythm if necessary. Because of Nick’s hypertrophic cardiomyopathy he has regular visits with Dr. Fricker and Dr. Bryant. He has had one cardiac MRI and regularly gets heart echo tests and 12-lead EKG tests. He has also had blood work performed to identify a possible genetic cause for his heart condition. In September 2012 Nick had surgery at Shands for placement of an internal defibrillator. He spent one night on unit 44 pediatrics. Nick’s brain condition, agenesis of the corpus callosum, is stable, and he has now mastered all of his developmental milestones to this point. He does get extra help at school and has an IEP because of his learning challenges. Nick has been a patient in the neurology and pediatric neuropsychology clinics at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital to help manage his needs related to his brain condition. He also saw the geneticists in that clinic to help establish whether his heart condition has a genetic cause. Nick remains a very social and positive guy. He tries his best despite his obstacles. Because of his heart condition, he is not allowed to participate in moderately-intense sports like baseball, soccer or basketball. This makes Nick sad because he loves to play sports, especially basketball, and is pretty good at throwing a ball. Nick is, however, allowed to participate in the sport of bowling. After being off bowling for nearly 8 weeks to allow his defibrillator surgical site to heal, he got back into the “swing of things!” Nick bowls every Saturday with a Gainesville youth league and participates in 1-2 tournaments each year throughout the state of Florida. In 2015 Nick placed high enough in a tournament to earn $115 in scholarship money! Nick is proud to be a Children’s Miracle Network ambassador! He wants to help other kids and support the hospital that saved his life. Nick particularly enjoys being involved with Dance Marathon at the University of Florida. He has met so many amazing college students who dedicate their time and energy to raising money for Children’s Miracle Network.

							'description' => 'Reilly&#39;s story started when I had my anatomy scan at 20 weeks pregnant. The OB spotted a "blip" on Reilly&#39;s heart and then referred us to UF Shands to get an Echo on Reilly&#39;s heart. There, Dr. Gregg performed the Echo and indeed told us Reilly had a CHD called Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome and tried to explain what that meant while showing us on the screen. After he explained our options, we told him we would do whatever it takes to save Reilly&#39;s life. He suggested an Amniocentesis test to rule out Dijorge Syndrome, and various other syndromes that can piggyback with this condition. We agreed to do it. Turns out he had perfect chromosomes and the only battle we were facing was the HLHS. So at 22 weeks gestation we knew about Reilly&#39;s CHD. We went forth throughout the pregnancy visiting  the Peds Cardiologist Dr. Co-Vu, bi-weekly to stay on top of how his heart was growing. We opted to schedule Reilly&#39;s arrival via C-section and at 38 weeks gestation. This was extremely scary since my first 2 children were natural with no complications. Even the week before Reilly arrived, the Cardiologist knew that he was going to need to go to the Heart cath lab immediately after birth and get the balloon plasty. When Reilly was born, he was breathing at 50% oxygen and suffered 2 strokes right before birth. So as we knew they would, they took him to the heart cath lab, performed the procedure and then he went to the NICU for 2 days. There, they performed Neuro activity monitoring and MRI on his brain as well as Echo&#39;s. Once he was stable as a newborn 2 days (and 3 dozen Krispy Kreme donuts) later, he went to the PCICU to be monitored before his Norwood heart surgery. He had the surgery at 11 days old by Dr. Bleiweis. A very talented miracle worker in my eyes. Reilly did great during surgery and continued to heal perfectly. We spent the remainder of Reilly&#39;s first 30 days in the PCICU and were discharged 1 month after his birth. Just 5 weeks later, Reilly had a choking incident where he choked on his saliva and we called 911. After we reached UF Shands PCICU they tested his heart and everything else which they found he had RSV (no symptoms at home because he had just gotten it). They caught that early and treated. We were discharged after a week. After that we spent his first Holidays at home and he did very well from then on. He was going to PT and OT as well as Neurological visits. At that point he was testing only 10 days behind! We were informed that seizures will always be high risk due to his strokes at birth. We have been fortunate not to battle that yet. Reilly&#39;s next surgery, the Glenn was performed when he was 5 months old. They also discovered Reilly had a leaky valve too close to the coronary arteries to fix during the second surgery, and also Reilly&#39;s heat function was not as good as it should&#39;ve been. But we continued through the Glenn surgery hoping his function would improve after. He did so well during and after surgery, they discharged us 7 days after surgery. Since then he has developed perfectly, passing all hearing tests and his heart function even improving with the change of some meds. Now he is 8months old, rolls around, eats baby food and tries to sit up on his own. ',

He experienced an acute life threatening event and was resuscitated only to be sent home on a monitor the next day only leading to a terrifying week.  Samueal was ambulanced to the nearest children’s hospital for severe bradycardic episodes and respiratory distress.The months to follow were spent in and out of several hospital ICUs with extensive testing and numerous surgeries.  Teams of physicians tried to discern the source of his multi-systemic health concerns: encephalopathy, global developmental delay, tracheomalacia, seizures, Gastro- Intestinal dysmotility and paresis, hypotonia, oromotor dysfunction, apnea, bradycardia, respiratory insufficiency, and failing to thrive on a GJ feeding tube.. While being told to expect that he might never walk, talk or live a normal life, his parents continued to fight for answers. One difficult surgical muscle biopsy results revealed what was threatening their son’s life. Samuel is fighting a mitochondrial disease. The mitochondria are the part of every cell responsible for creating 90% of the energy our organs need to function. When his body is compromised by stress or illness, cell injury and cell death follow. This condition is considered degenerative and  progressive and he has fought through very difficult metabolic declines following typical stressors, such as a warm ride in the stroller or even a simple ear infection. Samuel has this disease, but it does not have him. He has shown incredible strength and determination, defying all the odds and reaching milestones with much effort, therapy and support. He continues to amaze and inspire all those around him.

When William was 11 months old, he was hospitalized again — this time with rotavirus. It was during that hospital stay that his new doctor diagnosed William with Scimitar Syndrome, after he had received a chest CT scan done to rule out a possible respiratory infection. Scimitar Syndrome is a birth defect that adversely affects the right lung and right side of the heart. In June 2006, when William was 2, he underwent his first open-heart surgery. Life ran smoothly until August 2012, when Dr. Fricker noticed the slightest change in William’s heart. William had a cardiac MRI and then underwent his second cardiac catheterization. The MRI and cath showed that William had a blockage in his scimitar vein and had developed pulmonary hypertension. Five days before Christmas in 2012, when William was 8, he underwent his second open-heart surgery with Dr. Bleiweis. Since then, we have cardiology and pulmonary checkups every 6 months. In February 2014, Dr. Fricker noticed that William’s pulmonary pressures were creeping up again. In May 2014, William underwent his third cardiac cath. During the 8-hour procedure, they were able to balloon open William’s scimitar vein and his inferior vena cava, both of which were blocked. The angioplasty procedure saved William from another immediate open-heart surgery. He will need more interventions in the future, but he’s doing very well right now. He plays flag football and has been able to keep up with his friends much better than before his interventional cath. William has had so many “best days of his life”, a few of which were made possible by Children’s Miracle Network. Some of his other “best days” include being able to get out on the field and play flag football like all of his friends, and going to amusement parks and being able to ride whatever he wants to ride. He’s a happy kid who enjoys being active, playing football with his friends, hanging out with his older brother, Martin, and just being a regular kid.

When he got to the other hospital, the pediatric cardiologist just happened to be on the floor looking in on another patient. He saw Zander and called for an echocardiogram. Once the test was done, he told the hospital that Zander needed sent to Shands.  Zander was born at 2:03 PM on November 29, 2006, and arrived at Shands at 10:30 PM that same day. Zander got to ride in an airplane when he was only a handful of hours old.
															Zander was diagnosed with Transposition of The Greater Vessels (TOGV).  A normal heart makes a figure eight, whereas Zander&#39;s heart made two individual circles. When he was a day old, doctors performed two heart Caths because they wanted to give him a fighting chance for surgery. The goal of the heart Caths was to help Zander’s heart mix his blood while it was inside the heart. When he was six days old on December 5, 2006, Zander had his open-heart surgery for TOGV. The doctors had to take the two top ventricles of his heart, off switch them, and then reattach them to his heart in the right spots.  Then, they had to reattach the arteries to the ventricles. They left his chest cavity open while he healed until he was 10 or 11 days old, at which point they closed the chest cavity.  Zander got discharged from Shands on December 18, 2006.
															On December 30, 2006, Zander had surgery for Pyloric Stenosis. The “Pyloric” sphincter joins your stomach and large intestine. “Stenosis” signifies that the sphincter muscle was constricted. Zander was lucky enough that the doctors were able to use the incisions from the chest tubes to do the stomach surgery. They had to put a camera in to see where they needed to cut on the muscle around the Pyloric so that Zander would be able to eat (or in his case, drink) and not regurgitate shortly afterwards.
															When Zander was 4-months-old, I took him for his four-month check-up.  His pediatrician was immediately alarmed; he didn&#39;t even say anything to me. He just kept feeling Zander&#39;s head all over. Then, he just kept looking from me to Zander.
															Until I said, “You can&#39;t tell me that anything is wrong – Zander has to finally going to be able to do tummy time,” the doctor said, “I hope I&#39;m wrong, but I&#39;m going to send him for a CAT Scan.” When Zander was 4-and-a-half-months-old, he had head surgery for Craniosynostosis. His Sagittal Suture (front soft spot) had closed somewhere between birth and four months. The doctors made two small incisions on his head (one on the front and one on the back) to insert a man-made soft spot so that his brain would have room to grow.  When Zander was 5-and-a-half-months-old, he got a special helmet to shape and protect his head. We called it his “Buzz Lightyear” helmet.  He had the helmet until right after his second birthday.
															In April 2012, Zander got his first set of tubes in his ears for repeated ear infections.
															On November 20, 2012, Zander had a second head surgery for his Craniosynostosis to fill in the man-made soft spot. This was a week before his 6th birthday.
															In January 2014, Zander was diagnosed with neuropathy/myopathy, or unexplained leg pain. He hurts after a short distance when walking.  He has a wheelchair for long distance travel. Even though he is in pain, he will run around and play with his friends, or breakdance to his heart’s content. Zander always tells his doctors, “You can&#39;t tell me what I can or can&#39;t do. I am going to do what I want because I want to!” He is very resilient.
															In August 2014, Zander had a second set of tubes put in his ears, and in November 2015, he had a third set of tubes put in his ears.
															Zander has ADHD, a form of Dyslexia, and food allergies, as well as seasonal allergies, asthma, Acid reflux and Gas reflux (which means he is in a small percentage of humans who take natural gulps of air during the day), the neuropathy/myopathy, restless leg syndrome, and the repeat ear infections. With all that he has against him, he is one of the strongest, smartest, and loving individuals that you will ever meet. He can brighten any room with just a smile. He loves to dance, run, and play!',
