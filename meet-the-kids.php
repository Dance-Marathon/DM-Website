She continued to surprise the doctors by fighting to live. Next, her parents were told she would never walk, talk, eat, or interact with them. Due to her premature birth, she developed hydrocephalus, which means there was too much fluid in her brain. Because of this, she has a shunt, cerebral palsy, a cochlear implant, and other medical issues for which she needs continuous monitoring and treatment.
Today, she is 22 years old and eats what her parents eat - with a few modifications. Alyssa can hear with her cochlear implant but mainly relies on sign language to communicate. Walking is a challenge, but she does it with the help of a walker and many years of physical therapy. Once she gets to know them, her interaction with friends and family is outstanding. She has an awesome personality and loves to ride horses and swim. She also loves to watch movies, football, baseball, basketball and tennis. She also loves being an ambassador for the Children’s Miracle Network and Dance Marathon at UF.',

Annabelle’s family knew that having Down syndrome could increase her chances of having leukemia, but they never expected it to become their reality. The night that Annabelle was diagnosed, the doctors wanted to send her family to a different children’s hospital in Georgia, where her family is from. However, Annabelle’s family knew right away that UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital was where they needed to go and immediately demanded the doctors contact the oncologist there. Annabelle’s family wanted the best, so they chose the best. The best is what they were given.
Just a few days after Annabelle’s family arrived at Shands Children’s Hospital, Annabelle had a port surgically placed in her chest. While she was in the operating room, the doctors did a bone marrow biopsy to confirm which type of leukemia she had, and they did a spinal tap, putting chemo in her spine. She went straight into her first round of treatment, getting IV and spinal chemo therapies weekly - making Shands her family’s home for 35 days. At the end of that first round of treatment, they performed another bone marrow biopsy and discovered that Annabelle had achieved remission. Being well enough to go home, she received her second round of treatment in an outpatient setting, getting IV and spinal chemo therapies weekly.
Annabelle is now 4 years old and officially complete with treatment for cancer! Although she will need to be monitored with routine labs and checks and her immune system remains very weak as a result of the chemo she received, she is able to be home with her family and to enjoy school.
The level of care available at Shands Children’s Hospital has kept Annabelle’s family close. Her family was provided with everything they needed to make the hospital their home away from home during the worst of times. They received resources for both Annabelle and the rest of her family, including mental health counseling for parents, toys and movies to keep Annabelle entertained, fun activities to help keep their mind off the hard times, volunteer help when they needed a break, and all of the therapies Annabelle requires to stay active and thriving. Without these services, Shands Children’s Hospital wouldn’t be the amazing place that it is.',

Turner syndrome occurs in 1 in every 2,000 live female births, but even more remarkably, only 2% of children conceived with Turner syndrome survive to birth. From the moment Bailey was born, she was already a true miracle!
Turner syndrome can cause conditions that include heart and kidney defects, hearing or eyesight problems, short stature, swollen hands and feet, scoliosis, learning disabilities and even infertility. When Bailey was just 2 weeks old, she received heart surgery to correct a birth defect on her aorta, a common problem for girls born with her condition.
Bailey visits the UF Health Turner Syndrome Clinic every four months, where she is seen by many specialists, including endocrinologists to monitor her growth, cardiologists for an electrocardiogram and other tests and psychologists for education consults and dentists as needed. Because girls with Turner syndrome often have problems with short stature, Bailey started daily injections of growth hormones when she was 2 and will continue to receive them until puberty. Bailey was also born with only one kidney, which is monitored closely by her nephrology team at UF Health.
When Bailey was born, her parents were stunned by the diagnosis, having never heard of Turner syndrome before, and could only find scant information on the internet. The family was referred to UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital because of the breadth of care available from the Turner syndrome specialists. Without the incredible care available at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital, Bailey’s family says they do not know where they would be today.
People quickly learn that Bailey is just an active 10 year old that is not defined by her diagnosis. She has a bright, bubbly personality that touches lives everywhere she goes. Bailey loves American Girl dolls, playing basketball and her kitten Gracie. Bailey’s family continues to spread awareness of Turner syndrome by hosting Bailey’s Butterflies for Turner Syndrome walks annually and reaching out to other families affected with Turner syndrome. Her family is forever grateful to Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals and UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital for the incredible care Bailey has been able to receive!',

She had holes in her diaphragm, a hole in her heart, reflux that needed two surgeries to fix, ear surgeries, eye surgery, and more. Bailey also has learning disabilities. For 10 years, doctors tried to figure out how all of these things went together and could not. Then, a geneticist found it. Bailey has a rare genetic mutation called Kabuki syndrome.
            Bailey functions on her own. She sings, dances, rides her motorized scooter, and plays drums.

Some doctors say tricuspid atresia and others say hypoplastic right heart syndrome. In short, he is a single ventricle patient, which means he only has half of a heart but twice the fight!
 In December 2013, Bennett had his first open-heart surgery at 3 months old. The doctors at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital performed a bilateral bi-directional Glenn procedure, in which the doctors placed a band around his pulmonary artery and connected both of his inferior vena cavas to his pulmonary artery. The doctors believe that Bennett having the two inferior vena cavas is what kept him stable for three months, while most babies with his condition require surgery at around 7 days old. In July 2017, just before he turned 4 years old, Bennett had his second open-heart surgery. The procedure was called the Fontan procedure; the doctors connected his superior vena cava to his pulmonary artery. Since the pressure in Bennett’s heart changed with this procedure, they also removed the band around his pulmonary artery. This procedure is the final repair for his type of defect. If Bennett ever goes into heart failure, the only solution would be a heart transplant.
For now, the Jefferson family tries their best to enjoy every day and not take anything for granted. Bennett just finished playing basketball last spring, which was his first time playing in a recreational league, and he started first grade this fall. He loves superheroes, and he especially loves spending time with his big brother Tre. They both enjoy swimming and playing on their electronics.

Due to a severe congenital heart defect called Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, Camden was sent by air ambulance from Fort Walton Beach to the UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital.

After several weeks, his family learned that his heart defect was caused by a genetic syndrome called DiGeorge syndrome. Camden has since endured two major open-heart surgeries, two major abdominal surgeries, six heart catheterizations, and countless other procedures requiring anesthesia. After Camden suffered from complications from his second open-heart surgery, which led to right-sided heart failure, he spent five days on the most advanced and risky form of life support possible called ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). While on ECMO, Camden suffered a very severe and debilitating brain bleed, causing him to lose 95% of his motor skills.

One year later, Camden came down with RSV, and his heart failure became worse. At this point, Camden’s family was told that he would likely pass before he turned three. Camden clearly did not agree with that prognosis, and he is now eight years old and still going strong! Camden’s family is happy to report that Camden is regaining some of his mobility through extensive physical and occupational therapy, though he will likely never walk or talk. In addition to PT and OT, Camden works with speech and vision therapists to evaluate his progress and to help Camden acquire a communication device in the hopes that one day he will tell his own story at CMN events!

At around 18 months, her condition deteriorated, and she eventually went into universal organ failure. Her kidneys stopped working, so the doctors had to start dialysis. She was so swollen that fluid started leaking out of her skin, and her eyes wouldn\'t close.

Just as we were saying goodbye, a miracle happened, and we received a call that a heart was available. Miraculously, Chloe was transplanted the day after her 2nd birthday and has been doing amazingly well ever since. Chloe still requires constant care due to secondary complications including hypogammaglobulinemia and the newest to the list: aortic dissection.

Donovan is the sixth child in his family; he is their surprise who came full of surprises. His mother intended to have a home birth with Donovan, but when the ultrasound technician at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital saw his anomalies, she consulted maternal fetal medicine. Dr. Gregg came in and told Donovan’s parents his diagnoses. Donovan’s parents met with a genetics counselor, Jill, and she explained the many possibilities after birth such as paralysis, neurogenic bowel and bladder, and more. Children with spina bifida are known for snowflake qualities, meaning that no two children experience the same symptoms. The doctors told Donovan’s parents that he would have to be born by cesarean section, and he would have to have his open lesion closed between 24 to 72 hours after his birth.
Donovan’s mother went into labor five days before her scheduled C-section. Donovan was born in the OR with Dr. Gregg, and Dr. Governale flew in from Ohio to perform his closure.

Elie’s family was referred to Dr. Weinstein, a world-renowned doctor for GSD, at Shands Children’s Hospital.

Without this supply of glucose, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis and seizures can occur.

Since learning more about this condition, Elie can check her own blood sugar and ketones by pricking her finger when she is not feeling well. She has to snack very often and drink a protein supplement three times per day in order to maintain her blood sugar and prevent muscle breakdown, which causes severe cramping.

At only 30 minutes old, he was taken to the NICU due to low oxygen saturation levels. He ended up staying nine nights in the NICU due to an array of problems, including his oxygen levels dropping, random drops in his heart rate, low central tone, and difficulty feeding. Eli was eventually sent home with an apnea and bradycardia, or an A/B, monitor, so his parents could continue monitoring his heart rate and oxygen levels at home.

In Eli’s first year of life, he followed up with many specialists at UF Health Shands, including a developmental pediatrician, a neurologist, a neurosurgeon, a geneticist, a cardiologist, an otolaryngologist, and an ophthalmologist. Eli also had many tests performed, all of which came back within normal range, until his parents got the results from Whole Exome Sequencing only 8 days before his first birthday.

After he was evaluated, it was determined that it would be in the family’s best interest to transport Isaiah to Shands by ambulance.

The next morning, a social worker came to visit Isaiah’s mother. The social worker provided her with loads of information regarding what to expect in the hospital and services available through Children\'s Miracle Network.

While his parents had finally left the hospital to get some rest, Dr. Sullivan called to advise them that they needed to get to the hospital as soon as possible.

The combination of the cardiac and respiratory issues were preventing adequate exchange to sustain life. Doctors wanted to put Isaiah on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine. This surgical procedure would place a tube in Isaiah\'s neck to his heart, which would remove blood that would be replaced by oxygenated blood, which would then be pumped back in.
Isaiah stayed on the machine for six days. By this time, he had been in the hospital for two weeks, and his oxygen levels were finally improving. He was not able to be released until about two weeks later when Isaiah was able to breathe on his own, the oxygen level stayed consistent, and his blood pressure was controlled.

Izabella was eventually diagnosed with a very rare surfactant deficiency that prevented her lungs from functioning normally. Her condition was so rare it did not even have a name yet.

In May of 2012, when he was an 11 year old 6th grader, he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). When Jack’s bloodwork came back not as leukemia, the pediatrician told the family to take him that very day to see Dr. Slayton at Shands Children’s Hospital.

Their first few days were a blur of tests and meetings as they worked to define exactly what type and subtype of leukemia Jack had. They learned that instead of the more common ALL, Jack had AML. They also learned that it was in his spinal fluid as well.

The treatment for Jack’s AML was four consecutive rounds of chemotherapy. The doctors told the Murray family that he would likely be at Shands for six months and that it would be unlikely that he could go home at all during that time. And so they became a family divided, with one parent at home with his sisters and one at the hospital from May until the end of October.

Jack celebrated his 12th birthday in the awesome game room in Shands in 42 Peds with visiting friends, pizza, cookie cake, and games. As the treatment continued, visits like that would become less possible as he suffered the side effects and other illnesses that come with so much chemo and such a fragile immune system. He was able to keep in touch with some of his friends through Xbox Live and several sets of headsets!

Through it all, Jack was amazing. He defied the odds, and he was able to return home for a couple of days in between some of the rounds! Hisfamily was extremely grateful to all be together and know that he was asleep in his own bed! He always told the doctors, nurses, and his parents exactly what was on his mind. He didn’t complain (much) - not nearly as much as he should have! His distinctive sense of humor and practical jokes were a joy, and his family is so proud of him for holding on to that during his treatment! Jack has now graduated high school and attends college at UCF.',

Oliver and Jude’s first beds were the giraffe beds, which allowed nurses and doctors to access them while providing an environment similar to the womb. Their undeveloped lungs were the biggest concern, and they were intubated and given surfactant treatment to help the lungs develop. They were also treated with antibiotics, phototherapy for jaundice, transfusions for anemia, and constantly monitored for common preemie problems, such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or brain bleeds, which fortunately, neither boy experienced.

 Jude made slow improvements on breathing, but Oliver suffered setbacks after initially being weaned down to CPAP machines.  Oliver was diagnosed with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and required surgery to prevent oxygen rich blood from continuously flowing back to his lungs. This surgery took place when he was 3 weeks old and went very well with immediate improvement in Oliver’s lung development.

After getting through the first month of life, both boys were much less critical, though still tiny, and remained at the NICU for two more months.  Jude went home after 81 days, and Oliver went home on his 3 month birthday. Oliver’s PDA resulted in the diagnosis of early chronic lung disease, and he went home requiring supplemental oxygen for two more months. He has struggled with asthma since he was a toddler and had two short hospitalizations at 5 years old. Oliver is followed by pulmonary specialists at UF Health, and his asthma is well managed. Jude has had very little issues since he was a baby.

On July 13, 2019, the boys will turn 8 years old. They are two incredibly energetic, bright boys. Oliver loves science, technology, animals, and sports.  Jude loves history and is very interested in medicine and has called himself Dr. Jude since he was a toddler.',

TGA is where the two main arteries are switched, so the correct blood flows are not going to the correct areas in her body. Kaitlynn was born at 35 weeks. Her mother had an emergency cesarean section, and she was brought into this world on April 30, 2015.

As soon as Kaitlynn was born, she stopped breathing, and she was taken away from her mother right away. Thankfully, a doctor that was present for a "just in case" scenario was there. He performed a balloon septostomy, which put a hole in Kaitlynn’s heart to keep all of the blood flow the same. As soon as she was as stabilized as she could be, the doctors took her into the NICU to do everything else they could do to stabilize her. At two days old, Kaitlynn’s mother received a phone call from her husband saying that Kaitlynn has a blood clot in her leg and that they had two options. The first option was to amputate her leg. The second option was to give her a medication that would solve the blood clot, but it could also send blood rushing to her head and cause neurological damage. This was devastating news for the family. The blood clot was caused by the balloon septostomy that was performed right after birth. The procedure was first performed on the right leg, which broke the blood vessel, so the doctors attempted the procedure on her left leg, which was successful. On the same day, Kaitlynn received a blood transfusion.

When their child was 3 days old, Kaitlynn’s parents got the news that on Monday the doctors were going to perform her surgery. She was not stabilizing the way that they were hoping. Kaitlynn had her arterial switch, which is the procedure to correct the transposition, at 5 days old. It was a complete success. She did very well during surgery and surprisingly, did not need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A full 20 days after she was born, her mother was finally able to hold her daughter. After that, everything started to turn around. On March 27th, we got the news that she was able to go home soon. On June 1st, we were able to take our little 5-pound peanut home. Kaitlynn is now 5 years old and lights up any room with her bright smile and bubbly personality!',

Within the first few hours, it was determined that she had VACTERL Association. This is an acronym that represents a number of things. V stands for vertebrae, or spinal issues. Her L4 vertebrae is a hemi/half vertebrae, or wedge shaped. She has deformities of the sacral/coccyx and a tethered spinal cord. A stands for anal. She had a low imperforated anus, meaning she was born without the anal opening where it should have been. C stands for cardiac. She has Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (TOF/PA). The vein and valve that bring blood to one’s lungs from one’s heart was essentially non-existent. She has a number of other issues with her heart as well. T stands for trachea. She had a tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, which signifies the E for esophageal. Simply put, Kendall had an abnormal connection between her trachea and her esophagus, and her esophagus wasn’t attached to her stomach. R stands for renal. She has a duplicated collection system on her right kidney. L stands for limb. Simply put, some people can be missing odd bones in their body for no reason. This is the only component that she doesn’t have. In addition to these issues, she also has some extensive pulmonary complications as well as immune system complications.

Miss K had her first set of surgeries at 5 days old that included her first bowel reconstructive surgery and another to repair and reconnect her esophagus to her stomach. Her first open-heart surgery was at 26 days old. Prior to the summer of 2014, when her second heart surgery was done, she was placed on infusions to help boost her immune system. She continues to take these every other week.

 In the spring of 2015, Kendall had a cardiac catheterization done to help the narrowing in her conduit that was occurring due to her immune system not liking the donor tissue. She was placed on another type of Infusion to help stop her body from rejecting her new heart conduit. It didn’t help, but it bought Kendall some time while she had to have a second bowel reconstructive surgery done. In the summer of 2016, at the age of 5, Kendall had to have her third open-heart surgery - sooner than planned. However, as she grows, new things are found. In the spring of 2018, her family found out that Kendall likely had a small stroke after her second open-heart surgery. While the MRI was done to rule out anything serious, it was found that she also has hemiplegic cerebral palsy. It is very minor, and she functions very highly with it.

Kendall is followed by 10 specialty teams at UF Health Shands. It has been Kendall’s family’s home away from home since day one. The Lewis family  loves the pediatric departments at UF Health Shands, and they are thankful for everything Shands  has done for their family.',

In March 2004, Kinsey\'s feet began to swell, and when her mother took her to the doctor, she had no idea that their world would change drastically. Blood work showed that her kidneys were not working properly. The doctor referred Kinsey’s family to UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital, and their journey began.

 Kinsey was admitted to the hospital on May 6, 2004, and she was there for 12 weeks. In that time, she was diagnosed with Atypical Hemolytic Uremic syndrome (AHUS), which is now believed to be a different complement disorder.  Kinsey’s kidneys failed, and her liver and temperature regulation system stopped working. On the weekend of July 4th, Kinsey’s family was told to brace for the worst - there was nothing else the doctors could do. She was on dialysis, had a warming blanket to keep her temperature up, and had continuous blood transfusions to filter her blood. These machines kept her alive. Their first miracle was about to happen. Kinsey’s family and several others were in continuous prayer, and 24 hours later, things began to improve. Kinsey fully recovered except for her kidney function. She had a peritoneal catheter placed in her and went home on peritoneal dialysis.

For 11 years, Kinsey had dialysis. Her heart function deteriorated and returned - again with prayer. Her bones became brittle, and she was diagnosed with Autism spectrum disorder and several learning disabilities. Along with dialysis, she had several infusions of albumin. Kinsey had another setback and was diagnosed with Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which forced her to go to the infusion center for platelet infusions.  These are only a few of the things she went through in those 11 years.

On October 5, 2015, the Bogart family was called and told that Kinsey would be getting her kidney transplant. She had previously been on both the kidney and heart transplant list, but with the increased function of her heart, she was taken off of that list. She received her new kidneys on October 6, 2015, and a new journey began. One without the 10 hours of dialysis every day. Her family was hopeful and looking forward to trying to live a somewhat normal life. The kidneys started working immediately, but because her bladder hadn’t had urine in it for 11 years, they had to give Kinsey a vesicostomy.

She did well with a few complications, but earlier this year, her transplanted kidneys began to fail. There was no rejection, but the kidney just started to fibrous. Kinsey is currently back on dialysis and goes to Shands three times a week for four hours for each treatment. She is currently waiting as live donors are being screened for donation. Doctors are also going through past testing to re-diagnose her. With the advancements and new research in the last 15 years, the doctors have decided she doesn\'t have AHUS but a different complement disorder yet to be identified. Kinsey’s family feels blessed to be part of Children’s Miracle Network and Dance Marathon. It has completely changed their lives and helped them deal with things no family should have to. Their story continues, and they rest in the fact that Jesus has already won their battle. When we believe anything is possible, miracles happen.',

Lauren’s mother made the decision to bring her to daycare that morning. Her plan was to make a doctor’s appointment in order to figure out what was going on, and she was very concerned. At 8 am, she called her doctor’s office. The lines were busy, so she left several voicemails for someone to contact her.

Unfortunately, no one called the mother back. Later that night when she got off of work, she showed Lauren’s father her belly.

He had his first surgery at just 6 hours old, which was a septostomy performed by Dr. Fudge to help sustain Owen until he was stable enough for open-heart surgery to switch the aorta and pulmonary arteries. When Owen was just 2 weeks old, Dr. Bleiweis did open-heart surgery, an operation called the arterial switch. He came home for the first time when he was 2 months old.

 Today, Owen is an energetic 7 year old that loves playing with his big brother, Noah!',

She was hospitalized, and that was the first time we heard the words “mitochondrial disease.” The path to diagnosis was long and winding, as mito can be difficult to diagnose, and because there is no effective treatment, we focus on treating her symptoms.
		Powie sees nine specialists at UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital and four specialists elsewhere. Mito is a systematic disease and impacts many of her organ systems. She relies on many medications and several medical interventions to function. The Patterson family is very fortunate that Shands Children’s Hospital has a pediatric gastric stimulator program that has allowed Powie to thrive!
		Powie is now 7 and just entered 2nd grade. We now have the correct supports in place, and she’s truly doing so well! She’s a very typical child who loves school, her siblings, and her puppies! Dance Marathon at UF has become one of her most favorite things in this world!',

            'description' => 'Samuel Negron’s parents knew he was a fighter long before his birth. After a very complex pregnancy, Samuel was delivered at full term and weighed 8 pounds, the picture of normal physical development… except he was not breathing. Life-saving efforts in the NICU stabilized him, but with the limited resources of his small local hospital, his parents had many questions on the mounting unexplained health issues.

He experienced an acute life-threatening event and was resuscitated only to be sent home on a monitor the next day, which led to a terrifying week. Samuel was transported by ambulance to the nearest children’s hospital for severe bradycardic episodes and respiratory distress. The months to follow were spent in and out of several hospital ICUs with extensive testing and numerous surgeries. Teams of physicians tried to discern the source of his multi-systemic health concerns: encephalopathy, global developmental delay, tracheomalacia, seizures, gastro- intestinal dysmotility and paresis, hypotonia, oromotor dysfunction, apnea, bradycardia, respiratory insufficiency, and failing to thrive on a GJ feeding tube.

 While being told to expect that he might never walk, talk, or live a normal life, his parents continued to fight for answers. One difficult surgical muscle biopsy result revealed what was threatening their son’s life. Samuel is fighting a mitochondrial disease. The mitochondria is the part of every cell responsible for creating 90% of the energy organs need to function. When his body is compromised by stress or illness, cell injury and cell death follow. This condition is considered degenerative and progressive, and he has fought through very difficult metabolic declines following typical stressors, such as a warm ride in the stroller or even a simple ear infection.

Samuel has this disease, but it does not have him. He has shown incredible strength and determination, defying all of the odds and reaching milestones with much effort, therapy, and support. He continues to amaze and inspire all of those around him. If it were not for the care, support, treatments, and interventions provided by UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital, Samuel might not be here today, showing us all how to manage challenging circumstances and appreciate life.

Thank you for making a difference in the life of a child through the Children’s Miracle Network Dance Marathon. The results of your heartfelt efforts are made tangible by the smiles that illuminate our children’s faces despite what they endure. Just like the dancing spirit on that gymnasium floor, your spirits fill their hearts with joy and appreciation. Thank you for sharing this dance with them.',
