								<p>A new team called <b>Outreach</b> was created and is comprised of a small group of <b>Assistant Directors</b> that works closely with the Dance Marathon Alumni Initiative. The outreach AD's also work to increase UF faculty engagement and all of UF Health engagement with Dance Marathon at UF. </p>

									The Emerging Leaders Program is a brand new aspect of Dance Marathon at UF. The focus of the program is to cultivate leadership skills while also immersing one’s self in Dance Marathon at UF. The Emerging Leaders Program is completely separate from Captains and FTKrew and will have their own unique responsibilities. More information can be found in the <a href="/emerging-leaders">Emerging Leaders Program</a> page.
