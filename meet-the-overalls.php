Throughout my life I have had the great benefit of watching my younger siblings grow up. One of the most moving experiences is understanding that within every child is the sole desire to be a kid - to be carefree, imaginative and love without boundaries. Despite Zander&#39;s condition, he will continue to play until he physically needs to stop. As we were playing a game during one of the theme hours, I saw within him the sole desire to be like every other kid. His positivity, love of life, and unending strength that day will remain one of my favorite memories. </p>',

Every day that I walked to class I would pass by a plaque on the wall with a quote from Winston Churchill that read, “We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.” Dance Marathon has given me the opportunity to make a life. In my opinion, everyone has a favorite word whether they realize it or not. Mine happens to be a relatively simple four-letter word we whisper to ourselves and echo through our lives: hope. Hope is how Dance Marathon is able to give, grow and impact the lives of so many individuals. Hope is what drives research, fuels Healthcare and inspires every person to become involved within this organization. I hope for a cure and a day that I will no longer need to dance, but until then I will work tirelessly to pursue a life in medicine and fuel the hope that I see within every miracle childs face.</p>',

Our own little close-knit family stood right behind the families and kids we had come together to help support.
