One of the most moving experiences is understanding that within every child is the sole desire to be a kid - to be carefree, imaginative and love without boundaries. Despite Zander&#39;s condition, he will continue to play until he physically needs to stop. As we were playing a game during one of the theme hours, I saw within him the sole desire to be like every other kid. His positivity, love of life, and unending strength that day will remain one of my favorite memories. </p>',

Every day that I walked to class I would pass by a plaque on the wall with a quote from Winston Churchill that read, “We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.” Dance Marathon has given me the opportunity to make a life. In my opinion, everyone has a favorite word whether they realize it or not. Mine happens to be a relatively simple four-letter word we whisper to ourselves and echo through our lives: hope. Hope is how Dance Marathon is able to give, grow and impact the lives of so many individuals. Hope is what drives research, fuels Healthcare and inspires every person to become involved within this organization. I hope for a cure and a day that I will no longer need to dance, but until then I will work tirelessly to pursue a life in medicine and fuel the hope that I see within every miracle childs face.</p>',

My miracle child when I was a captain, Elie, decided she wanted to participate in the game. I remember running through campus with her pretending to be spies and find the "zombies." These "zombies" did an excellent job hiding and Elie kept getting scared by them and the two of us would hold hands and run as fast as we could so we didn&#39;t get tagged. By the end of the day, the two of us were exhausted from non-stop laughing and also running.

The bravery and strength all of our Miracle Families have because they have to go through such hardships at such a young age are so motivational. A word that is very impactful to me is Joy. For those who don&#39;t know, my middle name is Joy, but these families are my Joy. Every morning knowing I am having the opportunity to help better the lives of families and children that I have met, and even those I have yet to meet, give me such joy and never fails to put a smile on my face. These children and their families have taught me so many lessons I will keep for the rest of my life and knowing I have the opportunity to give back to these families half of what they have given to me motivates me through everything.',
