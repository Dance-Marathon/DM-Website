But, I can say that one stand out moment was when Dance Marathon had the opportunity to perform at the halftime show of a Gator football game. It was an incredible experience and in the moment I didn&#39;t realize how iconic it would be. After we finished dancing, our Miracle Child Geoffrey got to conduct the UF Marching Band while his story was shared over the loud speaker to the Gator Nation. What admittedly started as a selfish moment performing on the field turned into a beautifully humbling moment watching this amazing Miracle Child live out a milestone in his life. And at the end of the day that is what it&#39;s all about, giving the kids a chance to have a childhood and experience everything life has to offer. It&#39;s something that I will remember forever.</p>',

Our efforts, as trivial as they may seem at times, make a difference to these kids and to their families. That is something that has resonated with me and become a reality over the years I&#39;ve spent giving back through Dance Marathon and that is a driving force in my journey. This organization is more than simply raising money, it&#39;s more than an annual event, and it is absolutely about more than you or me. It&#39;s about being that beacon of hope, encouragement, and passion for everyone you come in contact with through Dance Marathon. It&#39;s about showing others that a group of passionate individuals can inspire people, come together, and make miracles happen every day. It is a way of living. This is why I choose to give back through Dance Marathon. Because in the midst of all our efforts, putting our heart and soul into the cause, we somehow get more in return than we could possibly have ever given and that is a powerful feeling.</p>',

I left the floor after several hours of dancing to go check in for my shift, went to 2nd floor and was in awe as I looked down on the floor. Hundreds and hundreds of people were mulling around, smiles on their faces, and balls flying, the energy was overly abundant. I then look across the dome and see several Miracle Family parents mesmerized by the same scene.</p><p>It is amazing that our event and our efforts encourage students to be ambitious, bring thousands of people together for one purpose, remind students and grownups they were once kids, and remind Miracle families of the pleasures and joys in the world, meanwhile DM truly has the ability to impact the future of our community and limitless children for the better.</p>',

Students symbolically stand for those who can&#39;t and in honor of what we would love to see every child doing, truly enjoying their time. I am involved with and passionate about DM because it reminds me of the struggles that exist and the luck I have had. But more importantly, Dance Marathon provokes anyone involved to look into the past at the medical success stories that have changed lives and ponder the future where our efforts will impact families, make miracles, and encourage others to get involved.

That year, Nate F. was our captain team&#39;s miracle child. Right before he cut off my band, he gave me a huge hug and thanked me. The entire team was crying and taking turns hugging each other as we realized a year of hard work and dedication made us family.

She told me that dancers had already been picked, and I unfortunately wouldn&#39;t be dancing that year. I was really disappointed until someone approached me about doing Jailbreak. I had no idea how much that little experience would shape my passion and involvement for DM. After meeting &#34;bail&#34; and hanging out on the floor with dancers, staff, captain and miracle families for a couple hours, I knew that I had to do more to give back. I had the amazing opportunity to be a Dancer Relations captain (for 2 years!) and be a part of an incredible family that took it upon themselves to make miracles happen in any way that they could.</p><p>When I see these miracle children and their families, I&#39;m reminded of my little brother. I give so much to this organization because it could be him, and I would want someone to fight for him. Being a leader in DM has given me the chance to surround myself with selfless, inspiring and motivated students. To see a group of people work tirelessly for a single cause and for the kids is truly amazing, and I couldn&#39;t imagine my time at the University of Florida without Dance Marathon.</p>',

Not only did I get to meet a lot of the families, but I got to interact with them outside of the hospital. I got to see the side of them where they forget all the hardships they&#39;ve faced in the hospital and just have fun. I specifically remember Zander&#39;s father so excited to show me all the pictures of his son dancing and doing cartwheels. I sat there for 45 minutes exchanging images and listening to stories. It was so inspiring to hear how proud he was of his son. Zander is not even a quarter of my age, but his strength and energy is something I look up to.</p>',
      'motivation'            =>  '<p>When I first came to UF, I didn&#39;t know anything about the depth of what Dance Marathon stood for. I joined an organization that talked a lot about T-shirt check-ins and raising money to participate in an annual event. I attended the events, checked-in for the mysterious “spirit points” everyone kept talking about and raised enough money to make it on the list to dance with my organization. Once dance marathon rolled around, I experienced one of the most challenging and moving moments of my life. I listened to children that weren&#39;t even half my age talk about hardships that I would never imagine facing. I saw parents pour their hearts out to a bunch of strangers, exposing their battles to a crowd of people. It was that moment that it started to hit me more that Dance Marathon was a lot more than I could even begin to understand.</p><p>As a staff member, I got to see an entire different side to the Dance Marathon experience. Instead of standing and fighting for those who can&#39;t, I was helping the people stand and fight. As a very optimistic person, I was drawn toward keeping the energy up and giving piggyback rides to people twice my size. I was the staff member that didn&#39;t ever want to leave, because sleeping was last on my priority list.</p><p>As a captain I was exposed to a completely different side of Dance Marathon. Rather than focusing more on myself surviving the endurance of standing for 26.2 hours, I was able to witness the entire purpose behind Dance Marathon: the kids. As a photographer at the event, I was able to roam the Odome and see all the different activities going on throughout the weekend. It truly hit home for me when I started to photograph the miracle children. When I would try to photograph them, I found myself surrounded by such smiles and energy. I started to get mixed up between who was a miracle child and who wasn&#39;t, just because they were such strong fighters. I was able to talk to the parents of a few of the miracle children as well. They&#39;re eyes lit up every time they talked about their child and were so willing to share their story and their experience. </p><p>I continue to support the cause because every smile, every picture, every story, and every tear is proof that miracles can happen. No matter how small the victory is, your efforts make an impact on kids&#39; lives, and I&#39;m so happy to be a part of it for three years and counting.</p>',

Within weeks and months of DM, more children have appointments and treatments they need and this is crucial to always remember. We do not dance for just 26.2 hours but for a lifetime and we will not stop until there are no longer sick children. Our miracle family stated, &#34;Dance Marathon won&#39;t be something you did, but something you do.&#34; This is why I will always give back to Dance Marathon for as long as I can.</p>',

She was diagnosed weeks later with Transverse Myelitis, which is a rare inflammation of the spinal chord. She is now paralyzed from her waist down. I am so fortunate to have the life I have and if I could do anything to help others whether that be simply making someone smile, it is the way I live each and every day. I stand for my friend who can no longer stand herself and for all of our miracle children whose stories have inspired me immensely to be a better person and appreciate my family and friends to the fullest.</p><p>It is not that easy to be able to find that niche and place you belong in at such a large university. However, Dance Marathon at the University of Florida is an amazing organization with so many members who have similar aspirations, to help kids. It&#39;s great to see an organization that influences so many on campus to give back to such a great cause. Ever since my first Dance Marathon as a dancer/delegate than the following year as a Family Relations captain, the feeling you get from simply standing in the O&#39;Dome is indescribable. Seeing the smiles and excitement on our miracle children&#39;s faces and watching thousands of students year worth of hard work all come together is unbelievable.

My nine-year-old cousin, Carmen Elizabeth Liehe, was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme, the most aggressive and terminal type of brain cancer. I never imagined that something so real would ever happen to somebody so close to me.</p><p>As a first year Hospitality Captain, I was fortunate enough to tour UF Health Shands Children&#39;s Hospital, but I didn&#39;t fully understand how incredible it truly was at the time. During one of our many family visits to California to see Carmen, I quickly began to realize the immense impact of Dance Marathon. Carmen&#39;s hospital didn&#39;t even compare to the spirited and energetic accommodations of UF Health Shands Children&#39;s Hospital. Because of these experiences, I have seen first-hand the impact that Dance Marathon has on Miracle Families both in and out of the hospital.</p><p>My family&#39;s experience with pediatric cancer has opened my eyes to the challenges and struggles that these families face each and every day. Dance Marathon has found a place in my heart and I am so honored and excited to serve on the Overall Team for Dance Marathon 2015!</p>',

It was a group of young people at the University of Florida participating in something bigger than themselves, and achieving a feat that could only be done together. It no longer mattered what organization each individual belonged to; instead all that mattered was the common passion for children and their welfare. I knew right then and there that I wanted to be more involved in DM and make it a central part of my life. That is why I applied to be a captain my Junior year and it is why I am now the Overall for Operations for this upcoming DM.
