            <p>Dance Marathon at the University of Florida is an annual event benefiting the patients of UF Health Shands Children's Hospital in Gainesville, Florida. Each year, students stay awake and on their feet, if able, to raise money and awareness for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.</p>
            <p>As a Dancer, you will experience one of UF’s most adored traditions. Throughout the duration of the Main Event, you will learn our Linedance, enjoy live entertainment, eat delicious food from our local Sponsors, and hear inspiring stories from our Miracle Families.</p>
            <p>In addition to standing, if able, for the duration of the Main Event, Dancers will have year-long activities to take part in such as a Dancer Retreat, Registered Dancer Workshops, bonding with their internal Organization and more!</p>

            <h2>Dancing as an Individual</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>You have the option to register to Dance as an individual. When registering to Dance, it will ask you which Organization you are participating with, and there will be an option that says “Participating as an Individual.” Once you complete your registration, a Dance Marathon Captain will reach out to you with further details.</p>
            <p>Individual Dancers are placed on a team called Gator Aides. Being a part of Gator Aides will allow you to make connections with other individual Dancers as well as our Miracle Children. Gator Aides have additional opportunities, meetings, and events throughout the year you can choose to attend that will allow you to become even more involved in our cause. </p>
            <p>If you have any questions about dancing as an individual or the Gator Aides team, please contact the Recruitment Overall Director, Olivia Humbard, at <a href="mailto:ohumbardl@floridadm.org">ohumbard@floridadm.org</a></p>

            <P>Follow the link and select “Buy Tickets!” Once you complete your registration, a Dance Marathon Captain will reach out to you with further details.</p>
            <p>Dancer Registration for Dance Marathon is open for two weeks in the Fall and two weeks in the Spring. To be a Dancer, participants must be enrolled as students at the University of Florida during the spring semester. This includes students who are enrolled but may have an internship in place of classes.</p>
            <p>Registering to <em>dance</em> is <u>not</u> the same thing as registering to <em>fundraise</em>. Anyone may register to fundraise at any time throughout the year, but Dancer Registration is only open for the two-week period in the Fall and in the Spring.</p>
            <p>You may register to dance with an Organization team or as an individual. If you are a member of an Organization that does not currently participate in Dance Marathon, you may start a team by registering on DonorDrive.</p>
            <p><em>Please note: registration does not guarantee Dancer spots. Dancer spots are allocated in the Spring based off of Organizational or individual achievements.</em></p>
