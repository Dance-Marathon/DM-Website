What a truly special and unforgettable moment as I walked to receive the award hugging some of the miracle children and their families along the way who have touched my life forever. This moment still brings tears to my eyes because I know that DM has made me who I am today, it has given me so much joy, hope and love. This award meant everything to me; it was for these miracle children who I will continue to fight for every day, for the millions of dollars raised, and for the passion I will always have for this amazing cause.

I owe so much to Dance Marathon and have been back to Dance Marathon for the past 4 years since graduating (of course virtually this year!!).

Lastly, being a part of Dance Marathon at UF taught me so much about hard work, passion, and dedication and I try to incorporate those values into my life everyday. I\'ve loved watching DM grow and adapt each year, and I feel so blessed to have been able to been able to continue to participate, whether it\'s in the O Dome or virtually. FTK always!',

					  <h4><b><u>FAQs</u></b></h4>
				      <p><b>Q: I have never been a part of the DMA before and just registered for the first time. What membership do I have? </b><br>
					  <b>A:</b> As a first-time DMA member, your <b>$40</b> fee unlocks the <b style="color:#617ba6;">Legacy Membership</b> for your first year. After your first year, you will have the option to pay the annual fee of <b>$40</b> to continue your <b style="color:#617ba6;">Legacy Membership</b>, or you will be automatically shifted into the <b style="color:#f79b63;">Miracle Membership</b> at no cost.</p>
					  <p><b>Q: What if I registered for the DMA in a previous year (2015-2020) and never renewed?</b><br>
					  <b>A:</b> You will be grandfathered into the <b style="color:#f79b63;">Miracle Membership</b>!</p>
					  <p><b>Q: Can I upgrade my <b style="color:#f79b63;">Miracle Membership</b> throughout the year?</b><br>
					  <b>A:</b> Yes! However, you can only upgrade up until one month before the event so we are able to accommodate for all of the additional benefits (i.e. t-shirt, brunch, etc.).<br>
					  <p><b>Q: I was a <b style="color:#617ba6;">Legacy Member</b> and forgot to renew... Am I still a member?</b><br>
					  <b>A:</b> Yes! If you do not renew your Legacy Membership, you are automatically enrolled into the Miracle Membership for the upcoming year. </p>
