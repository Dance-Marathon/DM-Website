                    <p>All UF students attending the DM at UF Main Event will be required to wear a CDC-approved mask at all times during the event. We will be advising all members to limit unnecessary exposures for two weeks leading up to the Main Event to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19.
                    <p>     -Masks with exhalation valves or vents that allow air to be expelled are prohibited because they do not protect others. </p>
                    <p>     -In addition, neck gaiters and bandanas should not be worn unless no other face-covering is available. </p>
                    <p>     -Participants will be asked to arrive with their own face covering; however, we will have disposable masks available if someone forgets their face covering. </p>
                    <p>During all serving and interactive activities, we will wipe down all frequently touched surfaces to prevent the spread of any germs or illnesses. </p>
                    <p> <b>GENERAL SAFETY</b></p>
                    <p>On-site volunteer medical staff will be available to assist with any injuries or illnesses that may occur throughout the Main Event.
This year, we will be implementing bag checks and security precautions to ensure the safety of all individuals in the O’Connell Center.</p>
